.Angular2 Errors

|Error |Signification 

|Template parse errors: The pipe 'myPipe' could not be found
|If you use a pipe in a template, you should define this one as a dependency for the component, thanks to the pipes property of the @Component decorator.

|Can't bind to 'routerLink' since it isn't a known native property
|If you use a directive/component in a template, you should define this one as a dependency for the component, thanks to the directives property of the @Component decorator.

|Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
| It's usually a path problem. Either the module loader is not properly configured, or the path for import is wrong.
Angular will serve instead your `index.html` because your server is configured to redirect every request to `/` which causes the error in the navigator.
